# Memory Game Project

This is a simple memory game project for my front-end Udacity course. The object of the game is to flip cards and match them. This game is also going to test your memory in a fun way.

## Getting Started

To get your copy of this game is really simple. Just fork the repository and clone your new repository to your local machine. Now just open the html file and start playing.


## What To Know

This project was written in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. Feel free to add new features to your repository and make your own. Maybe try writing it in jQuery just to get some practice.

## Authors

Basic HTML and CSS styling was provided by Udacity. JavaScript and animations provided by Mike Copanos.
